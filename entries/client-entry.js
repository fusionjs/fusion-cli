/*
Webpack has a configuration option called `publicPath`, which determines the
base path for all assets within an application

The property can be set at runtime by assigning to a magic
global variable called `__webpack_public_path__`.

We set this value at runtime because its value depends on the
`ROUTE_PREFIX` and `CDN_URL` environment variables.

The value of the env var is sent from the server to the client
by the `../get-compilation-metadata.js` file. It creates
a `window.__WEBPACK_PUBLIC_PATH__` global variable in the entry point html with the
value from the environment variables above

Webpack compiles the `__webpack_public_path__ = ...` assignment expression
into `__webpack_require__.p = ...` and uses it for HMR manifest requests
